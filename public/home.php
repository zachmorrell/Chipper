									be able to generator the meme of your choice. You will be able to save the meme onto your computer. You will 
									also be able to share the meme to however you want too. The reason meme are so funny because people create

									laugh or say something that is so true. The greetings card page is where you will be able to generate the
									greetings card of your choice. You will be able to save the greetings card to your computer or you can print
									it out to save it. You will also be able to share the greetings card to however you choice may be You can
